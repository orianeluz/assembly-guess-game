# Guessing Game in Assembly (AT&T)
This project contains Assembly code for a basic guessing game, written in AT&T syntax. It is part of a Data Structures course at Bar-Ilan University. The program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
